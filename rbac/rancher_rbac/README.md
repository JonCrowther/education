# Rancher RBAC

This README is for exploring how Rancher extends RBAC using GlobalRoles, ProjectRoles and custom ClusterRoles.

Source: https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac

## Setup

- A running Rancher instance
- A secondary cluster. I will be using a rke2 cluster in DigitalOcean, but the same applies to any other cluster
